# LaminateTools
Python based calculation of composite mechanical properties.

Code by Matthew Cowan

Substantial thanks to Vinay Goyal for all the theoretical underpinnnings.

*Initially developed for _AME599 - Mechanics of Composite Materials_ at USC.* 

##FLAG DAY WARNING
Substantial changes are afoot. Any previously downloaded code is likely to be broken. The wiki is now the primary design document, and all details of the implementation will be stored there.

The upstream changes will be held in the `RedFlag` branch.
